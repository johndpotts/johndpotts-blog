If you've been in front end development for any amount of time you've likely heard about Sass (and similar CSS pre-processors like LESS and Stylus). Sass is what I generally use for writing styles for projects, so decided to write a quick guide to some of my favorite Sass features.

Sass is a pre-processor, which means that styles written in Sass go through a compiler to produce CSS that is ultimately applied to a web page. For example, this Sass-

```scss
/* sass variable declaration */
$color-black: #222222;

.text-black {
  color: $color-black;
}
```

will produce the following compiled CSS:

```scss
/* compiled CSS */
.text-black {
  color: #222222;
}
```

Sass won't let you create styles that you can't in CSS - the benefit that comes from using a pre-processor is the ability to write more concise, reusable, and maintainable styles. Here are a few Sass features that come in handy on a regular basis:

## Maps

Most programming languages have some form of key-value pairs (objects, dictionaries, etc). Sass brings this capability to our styling. The syntax is as follows-

```scss
/* syntax */
$colors: (
  dark: #222222,
  light: #eeeeee,
);

/* retrieve a value */
.dark-text {
  color: map-get($colors, dark);
}

/* error handling */
.dark-text {
  @if map-has-key($colors, dark) {
    color: map-get($colors, dark);
  } @else {
    color: #000000;
  }
}

/* iterate through maps */
@each $name, $color in $colors {
  .text-#{$name} {
    color: $color;
  }
}
```

## Functions:

Functions are also an incredibly useful feature of Sass. The let a developer perform calculations and derive values for styles. They can also take in variables as arguments:

```Scss
/*function example*/
@function column-width($col, $total) {
 @return percentage($col/$total);
}

$total-columns: 12;

col-6{
    width: $column-width(6, $total-columns);
}


/*---Output---*/
col-6{
    width: 50%;
}
```

## Mixins:

Finally, mixins allow generated sections of Sass to be reused across different scenarios. A common use case for mixins is generating utility classes for size, color, and other attributes that could have a range of values. An example of such a mixin would be to create an iterator over a map of colors or sizes and use it to generate text or background utility classes:

```Scss
$colors: (
    dark: #222222,
    light: #EEEEEE
);

/*mixin example*/
@mixin color-generator {
  @each $name, $value in $colors {
    &-#{$name} {
      color: $value;
    }
  }
}

.text{
    @include color-generator;
}


 /* --- Output --- */

 .text-dark{
     color: #222222;
 }
 .text-light{
     color: #EEEEEE;
 }


```

These are just a few of the many ways in which Sass can make you a more efficient and effective developer.
