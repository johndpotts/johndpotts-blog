![karma, a javascript testing framework](/static/images/karma.png)

One nice part of Angular being an opinionated framework is that a component unit testing structure is provided right out of the box. When the cli is used to create a new component via `ng g c [my-component]` or a service via `ng g s [my-service]`, a spec.ts file is automatically created that will run via `ng test`.

Jasmine is the testing framework used by angular for unit tests, while karma is the task runner that executes the tests.

Here's an example of a test that would be generated for your main app component:

```js

import { TestBed, async } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

describe('AppComponent', () => {
let component: AppComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<AppComponent>

    // dependency injection is handled here - any services that need to be stubbed out can be given in a
    // 'providers' array and modules can be included via 'imports'.

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
    });
    TestBed.compileComponents();
  });

// this handles the actual component creation. notice that 'app' is the variable that
// refers to our component object

  it('should create the app', async(() => {
     fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
     app = fixture.debugElement.componentInstance;
    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
  }));

// additional assertions can then be added to test different component features.
  it(`should have as title 'app works!'`, async(() => {
     fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
     app = fixture.debugElement.componentInstance;
    expect(app.title).toEqual('app works!');
  }));


});

```

Angular unit tests are simple to work with, but what about when your components need input properties via @Input() in their ts files? Without required inputs a component unit test will fail. Fortunately it's incredibly easy to stub out inputs on a component. Let's say we're writing a unit test for a component called 'MyComponent' with inputs 'name: string' and 'verticalLeap: number':

```js

import { TestBed, async } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { MyComponent } from './my.component';

describe('MyComponent', () => {

let component: MyComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyComponent>

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [
        MyComponent
      ],
    });
    TestBed.compileComponents();
  });

  it('should create my component', async(() => {
     fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
     component = fixture.componentInstance;

     // provide inputs here
     component.name = 'John';
     component.verticalLeap = '32';

    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
  }));
```

That's it! Remember, even though we're dealing with frameworks it's still JavaScript, and all we're really doing is defining a property on an object. Now you can test components with input properties.
